# Firefox Add-on Submission Notes

## Extension Information
- **Name**: THE QUICKNESS
- **Version**: 1.1.2
- **Extension ID**: the-quickness@thequicknessteam.com

## Reviewer Notes

### Purpose & Functionality
THE QUICKNESS is a productivity extension that captures webpage screenshots and converts them to organized PDFs with user notes. This is a direct port from our successful Chrome extension to Firefox.

**Core Workflow:**
1. User clicks extension icon
2. Extension captures visible tab screenshot using `tabs.captureVisibleTab`
3. Modal appears for user to add optional note
4. PDF is generated locally using jsPDF library
5. PDF is saved to Downloads/THE QUICKNESS/ folder
6. Optional bookmark is created in bookmarks toolbar

### Source Code & Build Process

**All code is included and reviewable:**
- `manifest-firefox.json` - Firefox manifest with proper browser_specific_settings
- `background-firefox.js` - Background script using browser.* namespace
- `content-firefox.js` - Content script for UI and PDF generation
- `content.css` - Styling for extension UI
- `logo-data.js` - Base64 logo data (no external requests)
- `jspdf.umd.min.js` - Third-party PDF library (official release)

**No build process required** - All files are source code ready to run.

### Permissions Justification

1. **activeTab** - Required to capture screenshot of current tab
2. **scripting** - Required to inject content scripts and CSS
3. **downloads** - Required to save generated PDFs to Downloads folder
4. **bookmarks** - Required to create organized bookmarks (user optional)

### Third-Party Libraries

**jsPDF (v2.5.1)**
- **Purpose**: PDF generation from screenshot and text data
- **Source**: Official CDN release, unmodified
- **License**: MIT License
- **Why needed**: Firefox has no native PDF generation API

**No other external dependencies** - Extension is self-contained.

### Data Handling & Privacy

**No external network requests** - Extension operates entirely offline:
- Screenshots captured using browser API
- PDFs generated locally using jsPDF
- Files saved locally to Downloads folder
- Bookmarks created locally in Firefox

**No data collection** - Extension does not:
- Send data to external servers
- Track user behavior
- Store personal information
- Use analytics or telemetry

**User consent** - All actions are user-initiated:
- Screenshot only taken when user clicks icon
- PDF only generated when user clicks "Save PDF"
- Bookmark only created if user adds a note

### Security Measures

1. **Content Security Policy** - Strict CSP prevents XSS
2. **Input Sanitization** - All user input is sanitized before PDF generation
3. **No innerHTML usage** - DOM manipulation uses safe createElement methods
4. **No external resources** - All code and assets included in extension

### Testing Information

**Test the extension with:**

1. **Basic screenshot capture:**
   - Visit any webpage (e.g., https://example.com)
   - Click THE QUICKNESS icon in toolbar
   - Verify screenshot appears in modal
   - Add note "test note"
   - Click "Save PDF"
   - Check Downloads/THE QUICKNESS/ for PDF file

2. **Bookmark creation:**
   - Follow steps above but add a note
   - Verify bookmark appears in Bookmarks Toolbar > THE QUICKNESS

3. **Error handling:**
   - Test on pages with CSP restrictions
   - Test on Firefox internal pages (should gracefully fail)
   - Test with very long notes (should truncate filename)

**No test credentials needed** - Extension works on any publicly accessible webpage.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

This is a Firefox port of our Chrome extension. Key differences implemented:

- Uses `browser.*` namespace instead of `chrome.*`
- Promise-based APIs instead of callbacks
- Firefox-specific manifest keys
- Enhanced bookmark toolbar integration

### Code Quality

- **Modern JavaScript** - Uses async/await, const/let, arrow functions
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- **Clean architecture** - Separation of concerns between background/content scripts
- **No console.log in production** - Only error logging for debugging
- **Memory management** - Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers

### Potential Review Concerns & Responses

**Q: Why does the extension inject external scripts?**
A: jsPDF library is required for PDF generation as Firefox has no native PDF API. The library is included in the extension package and loaded locally - no external requests.

**Q: Screenshot permission seems broad?**
A: We use `activeTab` (most restrictive) rather than `tabs` permission. Screenshot is only taken when user explicitly clicks extension icon.

**Q: Downloads permission for automated saving?**
A: PDFs are saved to a clearly labeled subfolder (THE QUICKNESS) to keep user's downloads organized. This is the extension's primary function.

**Q: Code appears minified?**
A: Only the jsPDF library is minified (official release). All extension code is fully readable source code.

### Future Updates

Version 1.1.2 is feature-complete. Future updates may include:
- Additional PDF formatting options
- Multi-page screenshot support
- Export to other formats

All updates will maintain the same security and privacy standards.
